Entropy = 7.954442 bits per byte.

Optimum compression would reduce the size
of this 1073741824 byte file by 0 percent.

Chi square distribution for 1073741824 samples is 67096926.24, and randomly
would exceed this value less than 0.01 percent of the times.

Arithmetic mean value of data bytes is 111.5017 (127.5 = random).
Monte Carlo value for Pi is 3.485872766 (error 10.96 percent).
Serial correlation coefficient is -0.049148 (totally uncorrelated = 0.0).
