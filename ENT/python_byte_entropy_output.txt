Entropy = 8.000000 bits per byte.

Optimum compression would reduce the size
of this 1073741824 byte file by 0 percent.

Chi square distribution for 1073741824 samples is 268.83, and randomly
would exceed this value 26.39 percent of the times.

Arithmetic mean value of data bytes is 127.5035 (127.5 = random).
Monte Carlo value for Pi is 3.141298045 (error 0.01 percent).
Serial correlation coefficient is 0.000041 (totally uncorrelated = 0.0).
